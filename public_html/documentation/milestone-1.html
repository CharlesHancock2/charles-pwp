<div>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This PWP will be a professional portfolio website that will be used
        to aid in job hunting. I intend to make the site as clean-looking as possible while also being functional
        and user-friendly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p><strong>Audience:</strong> This site will be designed for a professional audience in the tech community,
        such as recruiters and other web development professionals, who are typically involved in the hiring process.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The main goal of this site is to demonstrate my competency as a web developer to
        potential employers and/or recruiters. I plan to use the site as a starting point for my portfolio so I can
        update it with links to new projects as my abilities progress.</p>
