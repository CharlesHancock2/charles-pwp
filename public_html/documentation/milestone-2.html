  <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
<div>
  <p>The top section of my website will be a brief "about me" section that will include some details about me and my coding knowledge (languages, frameworks, etc.) and professional work history. This section will also include a professional-looking photo.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The next section will be a container with portfolio links (wireframe shows 3 but I'll use however many I have, within reason so it still looks nice). I intend to use a small image of the site being linked, below that will be a title, and then a button to link to the page.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The bottom section will be a contact form with input fields for name, email, and a brief message to get ahold of me.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>I'm not positive on color-schemes yet, but I'm planning to use colors that are neutral, not too bright, look professional, but are still eye-catching and interesting.</p>
